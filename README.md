## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
## The challenge

The challenge is to build out an IP Address Tracker app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. 
To get the IP Address locations, I used the [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/). To generate the map, I used [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/).

My users are be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP Address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location
